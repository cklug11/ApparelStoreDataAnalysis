I am continuing to practice my SQL and Tableau Public skills. For this project, I looked at 4 years of data from an apparel company. 
After transforming the data and running several SQL queries, I loaded the data into Tableau Public to create an interactive dashboard.
I included a screenshot of my interactive Tableau Public dashboard, but the link below allows you to interact with it.

My dataset is from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jojopopo159/mock-apparel-company-data?select=Sales+Data.xlsx
